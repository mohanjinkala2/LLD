# **SOLID**

# Reason Why SOILD Principal are important:

-->(1) **Scalability**

-->(2) **Maintainability**

-->(3) **Testability**

-->(4) **Readability**

# S->SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPAL:

-->This principal states that a class should have only one reason to change--which means **Every class should have a single responsibility**(single job or single purpose).

--># **Advantages Of Following S**:

   -->(1)**Improve Maintainability**

   -->(2)**Improve Readability**

-->**Example:** Imagine a baker who is responsible for baking bread. The baker’s role is to focus on the task of baking bread, ensuring that the bread is of high quality, properly baked, and meets the bakery’s standards.However, if the baker is also responsible for managing the inventory, ordering supplies, serving customers, and cleaning the bakery, this would violate the SRP. Each of these tasks represents a separate responsibility, and by combining them, the baker’s focus and effectiveness in baking bread could be compromised.
