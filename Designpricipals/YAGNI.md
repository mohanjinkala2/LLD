# YAGNI--You Aren't Gonna Need It

  -->YAGNI is a principle in software development that **suggests developers should only implement features that are necessary for the current requirements and
     not add any additional functionality that might be needed in the future**.This principle is based on the idea that adding unnecessary features 
     can lead to increased complexity, longer development times, and potentially more bugs.

  -->**YAGNI principle is closely related to the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

# Advantages of Following YAGNI:

   -->**Prevents Overengineering--Overengineering occurs when developers anticipate future requirements and build complex systems to accommodate them.**

   -->**Saves Time and Resources**

   -->**Improves Code Maintainability**

   -->**Aligns with Agile Principles--Agile development emphasizes iterative progress and responding to change**
