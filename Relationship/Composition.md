# **Composition:**

**What is Composition?**
   -->Composition is a design principle in OOP where one class contains an instance (or instances) of another class as a field. The contained class is often called a 
      component, and the containing class is referred to as a composite class. This helps in building complex systems by combining simpler objects.
   -->composition represents a "has-a" relationship.
