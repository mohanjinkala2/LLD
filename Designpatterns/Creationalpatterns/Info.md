# **Why Creational_patterns are used**:
    >(1)Simplifies object Creation(Main Reason)
    >(2)Flexibility
    >(3)Maintainability
# **Types**:

  -->(1)Factory Design pattern:
         ->This is used when there is many types of objects like car,truck,bike etc
         ->here user didn't manually instantiate class for creating object i.e vehical car1=new car(); he just give input like "car" then we done all work in factory class.
         ->advantages of This design:
            i)Centralized object creation
            ii)scalability
            iii)encapsulation
